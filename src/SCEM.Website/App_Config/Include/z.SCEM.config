							PREDICATE
							
							The predicate controls what items are included in the configuration.
							
							Each include can also exclude specific subitems in various ways. For a reference of the most current predicate grammar, consult the tests here:
							https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/blob/master/src/Unicorn.Tests/Predicates/TestConfiguration.xml

							NOTE: after changing what is included or excluded, you should reserialize all items, or at least the added items for additions.
							NOTE: the "name" attribute controls the folder name the items will go into. If unspecified, the last path segment is used. Names must be unique across the configuration.
							NOTE: You cannot use excludes with Transparent Sync. See https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/wiki/The-Transparent-Sync-Guide

						SYNC TYPE
						
						Traditional Sync (the default) updates the state of the database only when a sync operation is run. It supports additional operations but can be more of a chore to remember to sync.
						Transparent Sync (preferred) updates the state of Sitecore instantly as soon as changes to files occur. It is optimal for development purposes, but has a few limitations.
						See the guide to help decide: https://github.com/kamsar/Unicorn/wiki/The-Transparent-Sync-Guide

          <!-- 
						SYNC CONFIGURATION
					
						UpdateLinkDatabase: If true, the links will be updated for synced items after the sync has completed. If false (default) links are not updated for performance.
							Updating links is important if you are syncing user-facing content where link tracking is important. It is not very important for system items (templates/renderings).
						
						UpdateSearchIndex: If true, the search index(es) containing the item will be updated with item changes after the sync has completed. If false, indexing will not be updated for performance.
							Updating the index is important for content that relies on indexing, which may include most user-facing content items. Most of the time templates and renderings don't need indexing.
						
						MaxConcurrency: Controls how many threads Unicorn can use when syncing this configuration. Concurrency can usually increase sync speed 30-50% over single threading.
							IF YOUR CONFIGURATION INCLUDES TEMPLATES YOU MUST SET THIS TO 1 OR YOUR SYNC WILL HANG INDEFINITELY DUE TO A SITECORE ISSUE
							IF YOU ARE ON SITECORE 8.0 U2 OR EARLIER, YOU MUST SET THIS TO 1 DUE TO A SITECORE ISSUE
						
							This value can be set to significantly higher than the number of CPU cores, as these are largely I/O bound.
							Use fewer threads for HDDs or slow SQL servers, and more threads for SSDs.
							For a SSD workload on a quad-core CPU 16 seems to be a decent number.
						
						NOTE: UpdateLinkDatabase and UpdateSearchIndex also apply to items that are reloaded from disk when using Transparent Sync, as well as normal Sync.
